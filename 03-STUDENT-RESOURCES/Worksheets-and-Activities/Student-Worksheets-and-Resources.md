Time required for cumulative benefits to equal total investment

RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK:

Risk Categories:
1. Technical: Model performance, data quality, integration
2. Operational: Process disruption, skill gaps, vendor dependency
3. Strategic: Market changes, competitive response, regulation
4. Financial: Cost overruns, ROI shortfall, budget constraints

Risk Assessment Matrix:
High Impact + High Probability = Critical Risk (immediate action)
High Impact + Low Probability = Major Risk (contingency planning)
Low Impact + High Probability = Moderate Risk (monitoring)
Low Impact + Low Probability = Minor Risk (acceptance)

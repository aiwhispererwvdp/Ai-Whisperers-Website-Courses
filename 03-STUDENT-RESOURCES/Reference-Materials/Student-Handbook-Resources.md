## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices and Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

#### JavaScript/TypeScript Best Practices
```typescript
// Use descriptive variable names
const userMessage = await fetchUserInput();
const aiResponse = await generateResponse(userMessage);

// Implement proper error handling
try {
  const result = await aiService.generateText(prompt);
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('AI service error:', error);
  throw new Error('Failed to generate response');
}

// Use TypeScript for type safety
interface AIResponse {
  text: string;
  confidence: number;
  model: string;
}
```

#### React Component Best Practices
```jsx
// Use functional components with hooks
const ChatInterface = ({ userId }: { userId: string }) => {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<Message[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  
  // Custom hooks for AI integration
  const { sendMessage, isLoading } = useAI();
  
  // Proper cleanup and dependencies
  useEffect(() => {
    const cleanup = setupWebSocket(userId);
    return cleanup;
  }, [userId]);
  
  return (
    <div className="chat-interface">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Security Best Practices

#### API Key Management
- **Never commit secrets:** Use environment variables only
- **Rotate keys regularly:** Update API keys periodically
- **Limit permissions:** Use least-privilege principle
- **Monitor usage:** Track API calls and costs

#### User Input Validation
```typescript
// Validate and sanitize user input
const validatePrompt = (input: string): string => {
  if (!input || input.trim().length === 0) {
    throw new Error('Input cannot be empty');
  }
  
  if (input.length > 1000) {
    throw new Error('Input too long');
  }
  
  return input.trim();
};
```

#### Rate Limiting Implementation
```typescript
// Implement client-side rate limiting
const useRateLimit = (maxRequests: number, timeWindow: number) => {
  const [requestCount, setRequestCount] = useState(0);
  const [windowStart, setWindowStart] = useState(Date.now());
  
  const canMakeRequest = () => {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - windowStart > timeWindow) {
      setRequestCount(0);
      setWindowStart(now);
    }
    return requestCount < maxRequests;
  };
  
  return { canMakeRequest, incrementCount: () => setRequestCount(c => c + 1) };
};
```

### Performance Optimization

#### API Call Optimization
- **Caching:** Store frequently requested data
- **Batch Requests:** Combine multiple small requests
- **Streaming:** Use streaming for long responses
- **Error Handling:** Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

#### Frontend Performance
- **Code Splitting:** Use Next.js dynamic imports
- **Image Optimization:** Implement proper image loading
- **Bundle Analysis:** Monitor and optimize bundle size
- **Lazy Loading:** Load components when needed

### Accessibility Guidelines

#### AI Interface Accessibility
```jsx
// Provide proper ARIA labels and descriptions
<div 
  role="chat" 
  aria-label="AI conversation interface"
  aria-describedby="chat-description"
>
  <div id="chat-description" className="sr-only">
    Interactive chat with AI assistant. Use arrow keys to navigate messages.
  </div>
  
  {messages.map((message, index) => (
    <div
      key={message.id}
      role="article"
      aria-label={`${message.sender} message ${index + 1}`}
    >
      {message.content}
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Technical Issues

#### Development Environment Problems

**Issue:** Node.js installation problems
**Solutions:**
- Use Node Version Manager (nvm) for easier version management
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Check system PATH configuration
- Try installing from different source (direct download vs package manager)

**Issue:** VS Code extension conflicts
**Solutions:**
- Disable extensions one by one to identify conflicts
- Reset VS Code settings to default
- Use VS Code Insiders for latest features
- Create separate profiles for different types of development

#### API Integration Issues

**Issue:** API key authentication failures
**Symptoms:** 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden errors
**Solutions:**
- Verify API key is correctly set in environment variables
- Check if API key has necessary permissions
- Ensure environment file is loaded properly
- Test API key with direct HTTP requests

**Issue:** Rate limiting and quota exceeded
**Symptoms:** 429 Too Many Requests or quota exceeded messages
**Solutions:**
- Implement exponential backoff retry logic
- Add request queuing to control API call frequency
- Monitor API usage in service dashboards
- Implement caching to reduce redundant calls

```typescript
// Example retry logic with exponential backoff
const apiCallWithRetry = async (apiCall: () => Promise<any>, maxRetries = 3) => {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await apiCall();
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
      
      const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000; // Exponential backoff
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
    }
  }
};
```

#### React and Next.js Issues

**Issue:** Hydration mismatches in Next.js
**Symptoms:** Content differs between server and client render
**Solutions:**
- Ensure consistent data between server and client
- Use `useEffect` for client-only code
- Implement proper loading states
- Check for browser-specific APIs used during SSR

**Issue:** State management problems with AI responses
**Symptoms:** Lost state, inconsistent UI updates, stale data
**Solutions:**
- Use React Query for server state management
- Implement proper key props for list items
- Use useCallback and useMemo for optimization
- Debug with React Developer Tools

### AI-Specific Troubleshooting

#### Prompt Engineering Issues

**Issue:** Poor quality AI responses
**Symptoms:** Irrelevant, inconsistent, or unhelpful responses
**Solutions:**
- Refine prompt structure and clarity
- Add context and examples to prompts
- Experiment with different temperature settings
- Implement prompt templates for consistency

**Issue:** Response formatting problems
**Symptoms:** Inconsistent JSON, malformed output, parsing errors
**Solutions:**
- Use structured output formats when available
- Implement robust parsing with error handling
- Add output validation and sanitization
- Use schema validation for structured data

#### Integration Challenges

**Issue:** Streaming implementation problems
**Symptoms:** Delayed updates, connection drops, partial content
**Solutions:**
- Implement proper error handling for stream interruptions
- Add reconnection logic for dropped connections
- Use appropriate buffer sizes for streaming
- Test with different network conditions

**Issue:** Multi-provider integration complexity
**Symptoms:** Inconsistent interfaces, different response formats
**Solutions:**
- Create abstraction layer for different providers
- Implement adapter pattern for consistent interfaces
- Add comprehensive error handling for each provider
- Use feature flags to switch between providers

### Getting Help Effectively

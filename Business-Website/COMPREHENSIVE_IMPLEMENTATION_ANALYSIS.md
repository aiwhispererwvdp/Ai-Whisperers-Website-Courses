  - No actual data persistence

Implementation Priority:
  1. Create comprehensive database schema
  2. Set up PostgreSQL database (PlanetScale recommended)
  3. Implement API endpoints for data operations
  4. Add user account and course access management

Impact: Core functionality completely non-functional without database
```

```yaml
Missing Revenue Optimization:
  - No email capture or list building
  - No automated nurturing sequences
  - No abandoned cart recovery
  - No customer retention campaigns

Estimated Revenue Impact: 25-35% revenue loss without email marketing
Implementation: ConvertKit integration with automated sequences
```

#### **5. Content Management (10 hours) - SEO IMPACT**
```yaml
Missing Growth Foundation:
  - No blog system for thought leadership
  - No educational content for SEO
  - No lead magnets or resource library
  - No content marketing automation

Estimated SEO Impact: 50-70% organic traffic loss without content marketing
Implementation: Headless CMS or markdown-based blog system
